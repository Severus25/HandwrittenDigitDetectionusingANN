# HandwrittenDigitDetectionusingANN
## Overview
This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The goal is to accurately classify images of handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark in machine learning and computer vision.

## Dataset
The project uses the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. The dataset is available from Yann LeCunâ€™s website or can be directly loaded using libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
